    <p>This program is designed to help students in introductory chemistry
    classes understand the concept of extent of reaction.</p>
    <p>The program starts with a simple reaction where it takes 2 moles of
    A and 1 mole of B to produce 2 moles of X. The reaction starts with
    1 mole of A and 1 mole of B. As you move the reaction progress slider to
    the right, the extent of reaction increases, the amount of reactants A and
    B decrease, and the amount of X increases. If you move the slider to the
    end, all the moles of A will be used up and the reaction cannot progress
    any further. The slope of the lines on the graph is equivalent to their
    coefficient in the reaction, while their endpoints correspond to their
    amounts at minimum and maximum extent.</p>
    <p>You can change the coefficients on the products and reactants to simulate
    various reactions. You can also change the initial amounts of the products and
    reactants to simulate various conditions. To simulate the reaction of N<sub>2
    </sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub> &hArr; 2NH<sub>3</sub>, set the coefficient on A to 1,
    the coefficient on B to 3, the coefficient on X to 2, and the coefficients on
    C, Y, and Z to 0. Then set the initial amounts to the desired values.</p>
    <p>You can also input reactions in terms of grams and molar mass. To do so,
    first select the mass mode. The program should then display a row of molar
    masses above the initial grams. Using these inputs, it is possible to vary the
    molar mass of the substance, and thus the initial moles of the substance</p>

<em>Notes:</em><br />
<ul>
    <li>Use the latest version of Google Chrome, Apple Safari, or Opera for
    full HTML5 support and best results.</li>
    <li>At least one of the coefficients on both the reactants and products
    must be set to a value greater than 0.</li>
    <li>The program rounds output values to a maximum of 4 significant figures
    and truncates numbers after 6 decimals.</li>
    <li>To "remove" a product or reactant from taking part in the reaction, set
    its coefficient to 0.</li>
    <li>Numbers can also be entered in scientific notation (eg. 1e3 = 1,000;
    7.2e5 = 720,000).</li>
